"""Continuity & slot-consistency layer.

The guards are strict by design: they block a video that isn't good enough to
publish. But a blocked video must not become a MISSED slot — the Neuro-Somaa channel
needs its daily Paris-peak uploads to stay consistent (consistency is one of
the strongest 2026 growth signals). This module reconciles those two goals:

  1. Guard failure is treated as RETRYABLE, not fatal: the pipeline regenerates
     with a NEW topic and re-runs the guards. A bad topic never kills the day.
  2. Every Paris peak slot is tracked so a slot is only "missed" after a bounded
     number of genuinely distinct generation attempts.
  3. Cadence is clamped to 2/day for the production schedule (the strategy
     engine may suggest lower while retention is low, but the operator's
     "2 Paris-peak videos a day" requirement wins unless overridden).

The pipeline calls `should_retry_on_guard_failure()` to decide, and
`register_slot_attempt()` / `slot_consistency_status()` to track slots.

    This function used to be a hardcoded `return 3`. That silently overrode the
    strategy engine's retention-aware decision, so a channel whose Facebook and
    Instagram completion sat at 19-24% against a ~70% gate still published
    3x/day. That is the exact behaviour that (a) teaches every feed the format
    loses viewers, and (b) YouTube's inauthentic-content policy targets. More
    uploads of a video people swipe away from does not buy reach; it buys
    suppression.

    Consistency still matters, so the aspiration stays 3/day - but it must be

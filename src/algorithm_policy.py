"""
src/algorithm_policy.py — the 2026 ranking policy, expressed as code.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
--------------------
Before this module the channel's "algorithm strategy" lived in three places
that quietly disagreed with each other: prose in docs/ALGORITHM_PLAYBOOK.md,
magic numbers in src/video_editor.py / src/script_generator.py, and env vars
in .github/workflows/main.yml. When YouTube changed the Shorts ranking math in
late 2025 (swipe-rate -> watch-time-per-impression) the docs were updated and
the code was not, so the pipeline kept optimising for a signal that no longer
decided distribution.

Everything the three platforms actually rank on is now declared HERE, once,
with the evidence and the review date attached. Every other module imports
from this file instead of hardcoding numbers. Re-verify quarterly: change the
constants here and the whole pipeline (script length, hook budget, cuts,
captions, hashtags, publish gates, learning thresholds) follows.

HONEST SCOPE NOTE
-----------------
Nobody outside Google/Meta can read the ranking model. What is knowable is:
(a) statements from YouTube/Meta staff, (b) documented product behaviour,
(c) large-cohort creator measurements, and (d) THIS channel's own numbers.
Every entry below is tagged with which of those it came from. Anything that
is a channel-specific experiment is marked EXPERIMENT so it can be killed
without pretending it was ever a law of nature.

CONFIRMED 2026 CHANGES THAT DROVE THIS DESIGN
---------------------------------------------
1. YouTube separated the Shorts recommendation engine from long-form
   (late 2025). Shorts are judged on their own signals; long-form health no
   longer helps or hurts them.
2. Shorts ranking is watch-time-per-impression, not raw swipe rate. The
   practical gate reported consistently across 2026 creator cohorts is
   ~65% average-view-percentage for sub-30s Shorts and ~50% for 30-60s.
   -> A 30-45s Short is the easiest place to clear the bar, which is why the
      master cut targets 30-42s instead of the old 40-55s.
3. Viewer satisfaction (surveys, repeat views, "not interested") outweighs
   raw watch time, and comments are weighted above likes.
4. Instagram runs separate ranking systems per surface. For Reels the
   confirmed top signals are watch time, then sends-per-reach (DM shares,
   several times more valuable than likes), then likes-per-reach. Reposts /
   aggregator behaviour is actively suppressed.
5. Meta shipped the User True Interest Survey (UTIS) model for Reels in
   Jan 2026: it asks viewers whether content matches their interests and
   trains on the answers. Sharp niche relevance now beats broad-appeal
   engagement bait. Facebook Reels also get a same-day distribution boost.
6. YouTube's "inauthentic content" policy (the July 2025 rename of
   "repetitious content") demonetises mass-produced template output — AI or
   not. Properly disclosed AI with genuine per-video value is unaffected.
   -> Every guardrail in this file that looks like it costs us volume is
      protecting monetisation eligibility. Do not "optimise" them away.

# they are still present in a deployment:
#
#   * they silently override the policy, so the code says 36s and the runner
#     produces 55s — the exact class of drift this module exists to end;
#   * MIN_HOOK_SCORE=85 was calibrated for the PREVIOUS hook scorer. Against
#     the current one only ~3 in 21 of this channel's published hooks clear
#     it, so nearly every run would exhaust its retries and skip the upload.
#
# A workflow file cannot always be updated in the same change as the code
# (restricted tokens, protected paths, staged rollouts). So rather than trust
# that they were removed, the code refuses these specific retired values and
# says so loudly. Any OTHER value is honoured normally — deliberate

# retention_gate:  average-view-percentage the cut has to clear to get pushed
#                  wider; expressed as a function of its own length
# decision_seconds: how long the viewer gives the video before deciding to
#                  stay or swipe. 2026 consensus across all three platforms is
#                  2-3 seconds. This is an observation about VIEWERS.
# hook_seconds:    how long the opening SENTENCE may run. Deliberately longer
#                  than decision_seconds, because the two are different
#                  things: the viewer decides mid-sentence, based on the first
#                  few words and the first frame — the sentence does not have
#                  to be finished for the promise to land.
#                  Conflating them was a real bug here: hook_seconds was set
#                  to decision_seconds, which at the measured speech rate

#   * Meta only: "subscribe". Meta reads a subscribe push as off-platform
#            promotion, while on YouTube "subscribe for more" is ordinary,
#            expected creator language that costs nothing.

# What is bait-free everywhere: a plain "Follow". That is the only ask the

#     20  addresses the viewer ("you"/"your")

#     20  opens a curiosity loop (explicit question OR implicit gap)
#     10  not a cold open
#     -35 vague authority   ·   veto (score 0) for fear-bait
#
# The gate is therefore not a taste value, it is a statement about which
# checks are MANDATORY. 80 = every structural check must pass; the curiosity
# loop is what separates a competent hook from a strong one, and the retry
# loop spends its attempts chasing it.
#
# This lives here rather than in the workflow because the previous magic "85"
# in main.yml was calibrated against a DIFFERENT scoring scale. When the
# scorer was rewritten, that number silently became near-unreachable: only 3

# would have failed their gates and skipped the upload entirely. A threshold

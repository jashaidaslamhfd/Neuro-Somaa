src/platform_cuts.py — build a per-platform edit instead of one compromise cut.

THE PROBLEM
-----------
One 40-55s video was being published to all three platforms. In 2026 those
platforms grade completion on different curves:

  YouTube Shorts   ~50% average-view-percentage for a 30-60s Short
  Facebook Reels   ~72% watch-through is where distribution widens (15-45s)
  Instagram Reels  first 3s decides; short Reels rewatched beat long ones

A single 47s cut therefore failed two of the three gates by construction, and
the channel's own Meta numbers proved it: measured average watch time on
Instagram was 2.6-7.5 seconds against a 47s clip — 5-16% completion, when the
bar is ~70%. No hook rewrite fixes a length mismatch that large.

THE FIX
-------
Generate ONE script and ONE set of assets, then assemble two edits:

  master cut  -> YouTube, policy-ideal ~36s, the full 8-beat arc
  meta cut    -> Facebook + Instagram, ~27s, the same arc with the
                 lowest-information middle scenes dropped

Because both cuts come from the same per-scene audio and images, the second
edit costs a render, not a second generation — no extra LLM calls, no extra
image credits, and no risk of the two versions telling different stories.

WHY DROP SCENES INSTEAD OF SPEEDING UP
--------------------------------------
Speeding narration to fit is the obvious shortcut and it is the wrong one: it
degrades the voice, breaks caption pacing, and viewers hear "AI slop", which
is precisely the perception both platforms' 2026 policies punish. Dropping a
whole scene keeps every remaining second natural and keeps sentences intact,
because every scene boundary is already a sentence boundary.

SCENE PRIORITY (what survives the cut)
--------------------------------------
protected   scene 1  HOOK        the promise; nothing works without it
protected   scene 2  SUSPENSE    the open question that stops the swipe
protected   last-1   PAYOFF      the answer; dropping it makes the video a lie
protected   last     LOOP-BACK   echoes the hook, earns the replay
droppable   middle scenes, weakest information density first
